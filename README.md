# Bluereader

_Bluereader_ is a free multiplatform RSS and Atom aggregator written in Ruby. It helps you read content from all of your favourite
websites without having to visit each one of them. The application supports multiple accounts, so that more than one user can share
a single installation of the program.


## Current functionality:
* **Multiple accounts**
* **Saving the web content for a user-defined period of time**
* **Login/Register**
* **Add categories**
* **Delete categories**

## Contributing to bluereader

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
